# OPS_README.md  
Operational guide for running, monitoring, and supporting this application.  
This document is meant to be practical and calm — something you can grab during an issue and immediately know what to do.

---

## 1. Environments

This project is expected to have three logical environments:

- Development (local work and experiments)
- Staging (production-like testing)
- Production (customer-facing)

Each environment should have:

- its own database
- its own secrets
- its own URLs
- its own logging and monitoring views

Never share credentials or databases across environments.

---

## 2. How to Deploy

### Production deployment (high-level flow)

1. Commit to main branch
2. CI builds and runs tests
3. If staging succeeds, promote to production
4. Watch logs for the first 10–15 minutes

Platform examples:

- If using Vercel: main → preview → production promotion
- If using Render/Fly/Railway: main triggers deployment

All deployments should be:

- reproducible
- automated
- documented here

Add platform-specific commands below:

Deployment steps for this app:
	1.	
	2.	
	3.

## 3. How to Roll Back

Assume someday a deployment will misbehave. The rollback path should be clear and boring.

Examples depending on platform:

- Revert to previous deployment in dashboard
- Re-deploy last known good image
- Git revert last commit and redeploy

Write the real process here:

Rollback steps:
	1.	
	2.	
	3.	

If the database schema changed, note if rollback requires:

- backward-compatible migrations
- manual intervention
- feature flag disablement

---

## 4. Logs, Metrics, and Where to Look First

When something goes wrong, you should not be guessing where to look.

Document the locations:

- Application logs:
  - URL:
- Database logs:
  - URL:
- Error tracking:
  - URL:
- Metrics dashboard:
  - URL:
- Status page:
  - URL:

Requests should ideally have:

- request ID
- user ID (if authenticated)
- organization/tenant ID
- route or operation name

When a user reports a problem, search logs by:

- time window
- email / user ID
- given request ID or error code

---

## 5. Common Operational Tasks

### Restarting the app
When necessary, document how:

Restart steps:
	1.	
	2.	
	3.	

### Running migrations
Prisma example:

npx prisma migrate deploy

Make sure:

- migrations are applied in staging first
- backups exist for production

---

## 6. Database Operations

This app uses PostgreSQL with Prisma.

Basic operational notes:

- Do not query production DB directly unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer read-only connections when investigating
- Avoid exporting sensitive data unnecessarily

Backups:

- Automatic backups should be enabled
- Document retention length
- Note where they live and how to restore

Write the specifics here:

Backup location:
Retention:
Restore process link/notes:

---

## 7. Background Jobs and Scheduled Tasks

If background workers or cron jobs exist:

- describe what they do
- where they run
- what happens if they fail

Also include:

- where failed jobs are visible
- retry behavior
- how to clear/repair stuck jobs

---

## 8. Health Checks and Monitoring

The app should have:

- health endpoint or platform-level health status
- uptime monitoring
- alerts for major issues

Document:

- health check URL(s)
- which metrics are watched
- who gets alerts and where (email, Slack, SMS)

Health endpoint(s):
Status page:
Alert destination:

---

## 9. Incident Response (Lightweight)

When an incident occurs:

1) Acknowledge it
2) Update the status page if customer-facing
3) Capture basic notes while fresh
4) Fix or mitigate
5) Add short post-incident summary

Post-incident notes should include:

- What happened
- User impact
- Root cause (as best as known)
- Fix applied
- Follow-up action items

Keep it short but honest.

---

## 10. Support and User Assistance

If a user reports a problem, try to collect:

- timestamp or rough window
- their email or user ID
- what they were trying to do
- screenshot if available
- any error or request ID they saw

Helpful app features (if implemented):

- impersonate user safely
- admin panel to view recent errors
- per-tenant feature flags

Always avoid:

- asking for passwords
- sending sensitive logs via email
- exposing other users' data while debugging

---

## 11. Security and Reliability Checklists

This project also includes:

- `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- `RELIABILITY_CHECKLIST.md`

Before major releases, review both documents intentionally.

They exist to make problems less likely and recovery faster when something does happen.

---

## 12. Philosophy

The goal of this operational guide is simple:

- keep customers calm
- keep you calm
- turn surprises into routine steps

A small amount of structure here saves a huge amount of pain later. This file should evolve as the system grows. Treat it as a living field manual rather than a static document.
